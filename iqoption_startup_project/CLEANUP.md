# Project Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup actions performed on the IQ Option Startup Project to remove unused files and code.

## Files Removed

The following files were removed as they were redundant after the project reorganization:

1. `bollinger_bands_strategy.py` - Replaced by `iqoption_startup/strategies/bollinger_bands.py`
2. `martingale_simulator.py` - Replaced by `iqoption_startup/strategies/martingale.py`
3. `main.py` - Replaced by `iqoption_startup/cli.py`
4. `bollinger_bands_strategy_modified.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook that was no longer needed

## Project Structure After Cleanup

The project now follows a cleaner, more organized structure:

```
iqoption_startup_project/
├── iqoption_startup/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── connection.py  # API connection functions
│   ├── strategies/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── bollinger_bands.py
│   │   └── martingale.py
│   ├── utils/

└── README.md
```

## Dependencies

All dependencies in `requirements.txt` and `setup.py` were reviewed and found to be necessary for the project. No unused dependencies were identified.

## Documentation

The following documentation files were kept as they contain valuable information:

1. `README.md` - Main project documentation
2. `README_BOLLINGER_STRATEGY.md` - Detailed documentation for the Bollinger Bands strategy
3. `IMPROVEMENT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Recommendations for future improvements
4. `IMPROVEMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of recent improvements
5. `CHANGES.md` - Record of changes made during the reorganization

## Conclusion

The cleanup process successfully removed redundant files while maintaining all functionality. The project now has a cleaner, more maintainable structure with no duplicate code or unused files.
