# Debugging Findings and Recommendations

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Websocket Callback Method Signatures**
   - **Issue**: The websocket callback methods (`on_message`, `on_error`, `on_open`, `on_close`) had incorrect method signatures that didn't match what the websocket library expected.
   - **Fix**: Updated the method signatures to match the websocket library's expectations:
     - Changed `on_message(self, wss, message, data=None)` to `on_message(self, message, data=None)`
     - Changed `on_error(wss, error, data=None)` to `on_error(error, data=None)`
     - Changed `on_open(wss, data=None)` to `on_open(data=None)`
     - Changed `on_close(wss, close_status_code, close_msg)` to `on_close(ws, close_status_code, close_msg)`

2. **JSON Parsing Error Handling**
   - **Issue**: The `on_message` method was trying to parse all websocket messages as JSON without proper error handling, causing crashes when receiving invalid or empty messages.
   - **Fix**: Added robust error handling around the JSON parsing to gracefully handle invalid JSON:
     ```python
     try:
         # Check if message is not empty
         if not message:
             logger.error("Received empty message from websocket")
             global_value.ssl_Mutual_exclusion=False
             return
             
         # Try to parse the message as JSON
         message = json.loads(str(message))
     except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
         logger.error(f"Failed to parse websocket message as JSON: {e}")
         logger.debug(f"Raw message: {message}")
         global_value.ssl_Mutual_exclusion=False
         return
     except Exception as e:
         logger.error(f"Unexpected error processing websocket message: {e}")
         global_value.ssl_Mutual_exclusion=False
         return
     ```

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Add more comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase, especially in network-related operations.
   - Implement proper retry mechanisms for API calls that might fail temporarily.

2. **Improved Logging**
   - Enhance logging to provide more context about operations and errors.
   - Consider implementing different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) consistently throughout the codebase.

3. **Timeout Handling**
   - Implement timeouts for all network operations to prevent the application from hanging indefinitely.
   - Add graceful handling of timeout situations.

4. **Code Structure and Documentation**
   - Improve code documentation, especially for complex operations.
   - Consider refactoring some of the more complex methods into smaller, more focused methods.

5. **Testing**
   - Develop more comprehensive unit and integration tests.
   - Implement automated testing as part of the development workflow.

6. **Dependency Management**
   - Keep dependencies up-to-date and specify version ranges to avoid compatibility issues.
   - Consider using a dependency management tool like Poetry or Pipenv.

## Testing Methodology

To debug the issues, we created a comprehensive test script with the following features:
- Detailed logging of all operations
- Timeout handling for each API operation
- Graceful error handling
- Proper cleanup of resources

This approach allowed us to identify and fix the issues without having access to valid credentials or a production environment.
